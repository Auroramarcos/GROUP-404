Overview
_________________________________________
Lost on Mars is an interactive and animated 404 error page that replaces a standard error message with a space-themed mini-game. Users can catch falling stars to increase their score, while a custom Mars graphic and animated starfield create an immersive visual experience. The project demonstrates front-end development, animation using the Canvas API, and responsive web design.

## Overview
This 404 is a short interactive mission: red, asteroid-like rocks fall toward Mars. Your job is cinematic and simple — **tap or click asteroids to explode them** and protect Mars (and Earth).

Explosions include:
- chunky shard fragments,
- expanding smoke puffs,
- small spark particles,
- and a low-volume impact sound to make hits feel satisfying.

The scene includes tiny shooting stars in the background for ambience and scales to different screen sizes.
